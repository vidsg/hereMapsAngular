IMPORTANT - Please read the following points before creating your application using this boilerplate:
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. Rename your application by searching and replacing HereMapsAngular with your application's name.

2. The css styles here are just for demonstration purpose. You should remove any styles that are not needed to minimize the size of you application.  Please read the comments in style.css for more instructions.

3. The same applies to images and fonts.

4. The main-nav bar is here for demonstration and should be removed if you don't need it.

5. To include html within a shared component, we can use directives and test it in index.html. (Also please clean up index.html before creating your app.  Again what is in there now is for demonstration purpose only.)

6. Delete the empty .gitignore files in following empty diretories once you have added code there: components/common, components/factory, components/filters, components/services, js/nonangular, test/e2e, and views/templates.
